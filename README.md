This folder contains the code to run experiments for the class project.


## Priming task

In this task we are going to study how the inclusion of a visual cue (e.g, a photograph) can influence word recognition.

## Delayed Gratification

In this task we are going to study how well we defer immediate temptation to gain later a greater reward.

## Anchor Effect

We tend to get stuck with the first piece of information we got, even if it is not completely relevant to the task at hand. In this task we are going to explore how different wording of the same question can affect our answer?

## Coke vs Pepsi Blind Test

This battle started long ago. We are going to study if people follow their preference on a blind test and if they can truly identify their beloved brand.

Here's the text that was presented for the experiment:  

*This is a blind test experiment.*
*I have two cups, one of them contains Coke and the other contains Pepsi.* 
*Please drink from both.*
*Which one do you like the most?*
*Can you tell the difference?*
*Can you guess which one is coke?* 

## Conjunction Fallacy

\begin{equation}

P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) 

\end{equation}
