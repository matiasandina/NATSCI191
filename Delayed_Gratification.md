# Background

In this task we are going to study how well we defer immediate temptation to gain later a greater reward.  

# Method

For this experiment, subjects received the following 3 questions:

> What do you prefer: a $50 cash prize now or a $60 cash prize in one month?
> What do you prefer: a $50 cash prize in 12 months or a $60 cash prize in 13 months?
> An insurance company held a lottery and you won a $1000 cash bonus. You have been offered two options: You can either take the $1000 now or allow the company to keep the money until you are 65 years old and receive $100,000


# The Data

The raw information is on a `.csv` file called `delayed-trials.csv`. You can open this file on Excel. Other source of information is `delayed-table.csv`. Here you will find answers aggregated by group.

# Exercises

First, we want to take a look at how people decide, can they wait for a greater reward or not?
Second we want to do a control, we would expect the groups to take equal decisions, after all they were the same questions. Is this the case?

Let's do some plots!

```
1. Open the "delayed-trials.csv" 
1. Make 3 piecharts or stacked barplots with the answers to the 3 questions
1. Open "delayed-table.csv"
1. Make 3 lineplots showing if belonging to Group 1 or Group 2 influenced the decision on each of the questions
```

Choose colors that sound appropriate. Remember that color blind people have difficulties distinguishing some color combinations, more info [here](https://www.robotswillkillusall.org/static/flabpal-colorblind.png)
