# Background

In this task we are going to study how the inclusion of a visual cue (e.g, a photograph) can influence word recognition.  

# Method

For this experiment, subjects were presented with images and asked to complete the first letter of a word. Participants were separated into 2 groups. Group 1 saw a series of images and group 2 saw a different series of images. Both groups were tested on the same words to complete.

## Example Doctor vs Wallet
